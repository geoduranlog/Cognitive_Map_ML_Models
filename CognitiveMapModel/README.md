The aim of the project is to provide a computational framework for cognitive maps that
distinguishes between different aspects of cognitive maps (i.e., reference frame, scale, metric,
level of abstraction) without having to complicate the experimental design. This framework
will consist of computational models that are relatively easy to evaluate quantitatively. The
proposed model will be built on a existed one from general cognition literature (e.g., Gen-
eralized Context Model) and verified with a training procedure from real experimental data
using machine learning algorithms.
